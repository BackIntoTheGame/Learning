1. One of the components of a computer is its CPU. What is a CPU and what role does it play in a computer?
   - A CPU is a chip that does the computation tasks for a computer and it's the brain of computer.
   - Official answer: The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is the active part of the computer. Its function is to execute programs that are coded in machine language and stored in the main memory (RAM) of the computer. It does this by repeating the fetch-and-execute cycle over and over; that is, it repeatedly fetches a machine language instruction from memory and executes it.
2. Explain what is meant by an “asynchronous event.” Give some examples.
   - Asynchronous event executes outside of the flow in a orderly execution. E.g. Ajax in a page that loads partially.
   - Official answer: An asynchronous event is one that occurs at an unpredictable time outside the control of the program that the CPU is running. It is not "synchronized" with the program. An example would be when the user presses a key on the keyboard or clicks the mouse button. (These events generate "interrupts" that cause the CPU to interrupt what it is doing and to take some action to handle the asynchronous event. After handling the event, the CPU returns to what it was doing before it was interrupted.)
3. What is the difference between a “compiler” and an “interpreter”?
   - A compiler translates languages into another programming languages which still can't be executed by CPU, but an interpreter translates into a languages that can be executed by CPU directly.
   - Official answer: Compilers and interpreters have similar functions: They take a program written in some programming language and translate it into machine language. A compiler does the translation all at once. It produces a complete machine language program that can then be executed. An interpreter, on the other hand, just translates one instruction at a time, and then executes that instruction immediately. (Java uses a compiler to translate java programs into Java Bytecode, which is a machine language for the imaginary Java Virtual Machine. Java Bytecode programs are then executed by an interpreter.)
4. Explain the difference between high-level languages and machine language.
   - Hign-level languages are readable by human beings. Machine language is readable by certain CPUs.
   - Official answer: Programs written in the machine language of a given type of computer can be directly executed by the CPU of that type of computer. High-level language programs must be translated into machine language before they can be executed. (Machine language instructions are encoded as binary numbers that are meant to be used by a machine, not read or written by people. High-level languages use a syntax that is closer to human language.)


5. If you have the source code for a Java program, and you want to run that program, you will need both a compiler and an interpreter. What does the Java compiler do, and what does the Java interpreter do?
6. What is a subroutine?
7. Java is an object-oriented programming language. What is an object?
8. What is a variable? (There are four different ideas associated with variables in Java. Try to mention all four aspects in your answer. Hint: One of the aspects is the variable’s name.)
9.  Java is a “platform-independent language.” What does this mean?
10. What is the “Internet”? Give some examples of how it is used. (What kind of services does it provide?)
